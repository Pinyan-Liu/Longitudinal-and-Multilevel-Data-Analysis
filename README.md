The observational study aimed at detecting effects of different heart valves differing on the type of the tissue implanted in the aortic position, homograft or stentless porcine tissue. A 10-year period study involving 256 patients was conducted to evaluate the short and long term profile and determine the factors that influence the effect and rate of ventricular mass regression with time after aortic valve replacement.
